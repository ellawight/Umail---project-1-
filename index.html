	<h2>About</h2>


<div>
	<p>Umail is an APP based programme that can be downloaded to any device to provide a quicker and more personal approach to Email communication. Umail gives the user the option to send voice messages either as a voice recording to send to the recipient (with a playback option before sending) or physically calling while sitting at your desk and not having to pick up your phone. Umail users accept whom they want to communicate with so that they do not get phone or voice message spam. Emailing is one of the most used applications of the Internet. There are currently around 2.6 billion active email accounts in operation with 3.5 million emails sent every second. Email, however has disadvantages as a form of communication. It lacks a personal touch when some things are better verbally communicated. I found inspiration for my idea through the use of  <a href=https://www.apple.com/nz/siri/ id="Siri"> Siri</a> and <a href=https://otter.ai/login?a=cHVibGljX2dyb3Vw&r=%2F%3Fkeywordgroup%3Dvoice%2520recording%26utm_campaign%3Dtranscription%26utm_source%3Dgoogle_ads%26medium%3Dcpc%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwsuP5BRCoARIsAPtX_wFJLU9Znyc7_QI3jPBXEWyicXTAH_2V87SE86o8vI-IGbP67hz4XNQaAtGeEALw_wcB id="Otter Ai"> Otter Ai</a>.

	<h2>Aim</h2>
	<p>Reading, writing and responding to traditional written Emails can be very time consuming and overwhelming. Typing messages using a keypad can also lack personal touch as it is hard to understand peoples tone in their messages. Whereas with using Umail there is the option of voice recording messages, it means people can listen to the recordings and understand the tone of voice being used. Email can cause misunderstandings because it based entirely on non-verbal communication. 

	Emails can also be fired off in the heat of the moment and once sent cannot be deleted or edited. Umail aims to remove these disadvantages of traditional Email. Umail makes communication more personal and less time consuming. It also will reduce misunderstanding from the written word, as it is easier to rely meaning and feeling in the spoken form. Umail aims to help reduce the excessive often-overwhelming amounts of written emails and spam.

	<h2>Target</h2>
	<p>Umail is targeted at people who use traditional emailing every day and want a more personal option to their communication. It is designed to keep your privacy controlled to only people you have given your Umail link to. Umails main target audience are people who work mostly from computers all day, such as businessmen who are constantly receiving or sending emails to clients with in-depth replies. Universityâ€™s and high schools would also benefit from using Umail, it would save teachers hours of work replying to students wanting feedback or asking questions about upcoming assignments. Due to the current circumstances with Covid-19, Umail would be very beneficial to many different companies working from home as well as businessmen and universities.
